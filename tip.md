When we write “ou” in Japanese, we pronounce this as a stretched out “o” sound.

It sounds similar to the “o” in “cocoa”. We also write “ei” but when we say it, we stretch the “e” sound in a similar way to the “a” in “Amy”.

When talking to our friends or someone younger than us, instead of using "san", we can add "kun" to male names and "chan" to female names.

The small "tsu" (っ) cannot be used before the hiragana な (na), に (ni), ぬ (nu), ね (ne), and の (no). To make these consonants long, we add ん (n).
