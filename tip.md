When we write “ou” in Japanese, we pronounce this as a stretched out “o” sound.

It sounds similar to the “o” in “cocoa”. We also write “ei” but when we say it, we stretch the “e” sound in a similar way to the “a” in “Amy”.

When talking to our friends or someone younger than us, instead of using "san", we can add "kun" to male names and "chan" to female names.

The small "tsu" (っ) cannot be used before the hiragana な (na), に (ni), ぬ (nu), ね (ne), and の (no). To make these consonants long, we add ん (n).

Kanji originally came from China, and almost all of them have 2 readings. These are kun-reading, a native Japanese reading 🇯🇵 and on-reading, a reading that was borrowed from Chinese 🇨🇳 and later changed to fit the Japanese sound system. Some kanji even have several kun- and on- readings!
It depends on the context whether we use kun- or on- readings. You can see all of them below, but for now we'll focus on the readings you already know. We'll learn others later in the course.

|Kanji|On-reading|Kun-reading|
| :-: | :-:  | :-----------: |
| 一  | いち |     ひとつ     |
| 二  | に   |     ふたつ     |
| 三  | さん |     みっつ     |
| 四  | し   | よん ; よ ; よっつ |
| 五  | ご   |     いつつ     |

So far, we've been usingじゃないです for negative na-adjective + noun sentences.
To make this more formal, we can change the ending to ではありません.
Have a look at the sentences below meaning "I'm not well". 🤒
