When we write “ou” in Japanese, we pronounce this as a stretched out “o” sound.

It sounds similar to the “o” in “cocoa”. We also write “ei” but when we say it, we stretch the “e” sound in a similar way to the “a” in “Amy”.

When talking to our friends or someone younger than us, instead of using "san", we can add "kun" to male names and "chan" to female names.

The small "tsu" (っ) cannot be used before the hiragana な (na), に (ni), ぬ (nu), ね (ne), and の (no). To make these consonants long, we add ん (n).

Kanji originally came from China, and almost all of them have 2 readings. These are kun-reading, a native Japanese reading 🇯🇵 and on-reading, a reading that was borrowed from Chinese 🇨🇳 and later changed to fit the Japanese sound system. Some kanji even have several kun- and on- readings!
It depends on the context whether we use kun- or on- readings. You can see all of them below, but for now we'll focus on the readings you already know. We'll learn others later in the course.

|Kanji|On-reading|Kun-reading|
| :-: | :-:  | :-----------: |
| 一  | いち |     ひとつ     |
| 二  | に   |     ふたつ     |
| 三  | さん |     みっつ     |
| 四  | し   | よん ; よ ; よっつ |
| 五  | ご   |     いつつ     |

So far, we've been using じゃないです for negative na-adjective + noun sentences.
To make this more formal, we can change the ending to ではありません.
Have a look at the sentences below meaning "I'm not well". 🤒

|             |                      |
| :---------: | :-----------------:  |
|more casual  |  げんきじゃないです。  |
|     ⇅      |  げんきじゃありません。 |
|     ⇅      |  げんきではないです。   |
| more formal |  げんきではありません。 |

To make the "(noun / na-adjective) じゃなかったです" sentences more formal, change:
じゃ → では
なかったです → ありませんでした.

Have a look at the sentences below, which all mean "I was not well". 🤒

|             |                      |
| :---------: | :-----------------:  |
|more casual  |  げんきじゃなかったです。  |
|     ⇅      |  げんきじゃありませんでした。 |
|     ⇅      |  げんきではなかったです。   |
| more formal |  げんきではありませんでした。 |

まで？までに？

We've learned that まで means “until; to”. までに sounds similar and it might be confusing!

Take a look at the examples below and make sure you understand the differences:

+ 十時まで寝ます。(I sleep until 10.) 

+ 十時までに寝ます。(I go to bed by 10.)

すーして

For the て form of U verbs that end with す, we just need to change す to して.

|はなす |はなして|

くーいて、ぐーいで

For the て form of the U verbs that end with く, we just need to change く to いて.
But there is one exception to this! The verb "to go" 行く/いく has a form of 行って/いって as it is easier to pronounce than a double い!

For the て form of the U verbs that end with ぐ, we just need to change ぐ to いで. (Remember to use ゛! ) To practise this pattern, let's learn a new verb, およぐ (to swim).

|      |      |
| :--: | :--: |
|dictionary form|て form|
|かく (to write) |かいて|
|行く/いく (to go) |行って/いって|
|およぐ (to swim) |およいで|
